## The Story of Our App

### Situation

In the beginning of our research, we talked to David. David is a young 25 year old from Oak Park, Michigan. David is a movie lover, no matter the genre. He loves to discuss movies with his friends. David wanted to figure out a way where him and his friends could test their knowledge on iconic movies scenes.
 
  Movie buffs like David would like to play a game in which he and his friends test their knowledge of movies.

### Complication

When looking he found some movie trivia apps but nothing he could play with his friends. The next time he was with his friends they talked about their favorite movie scenes. 

After seeing how fun it was to talk about and describe their favorite movie scenes they inspired us to make a spin on entertainment and movie games that could be made.

With the idea still fresh in our minds we decided to come up with a movie game app that includes a mix of re-enacting/drawing iconic movie scenes and leaving it up to the other players to figure out which scene or movie was being shown to them.

### Action
When it comes down to us making an app for David and his friend we had to make sure the app is catered to their needs. We know their main need is to challenge each other on whether they can guess a movie by drawing or re-enacting a scene from that movie. Some other needs we are working on is that this game is going to be catered to everyones movies tastes, for example we know David likes comedy movies so guessing movies with funny scenes in it should be easy for David, but what about when it comes to his friend, who likes romantic drama movies. We want to make a movie game app that is all-around fun for David and his friends.

Before we get started on the app we had to put thoughts to action and get a few volunteers to play the game in person to get the right amount of feedback.
From our research we found out people like being timed while acting out the scenes. Some movies are also harder to be acted out because of the difference in the age demographic.


### Result

David will say it’s most fun app he’s ever played. And his family will host a house party, and this will be the first game they play after dinner. And he will be impressed by the range of movies, from very well known movies with John Williams scores like E. T. and Empire Strikes Back for the easy level to obscure movies like Robert Bresson’s Mouchette. That last one is a movie so obscure that the auto-correct didn’t want to let me type it.
